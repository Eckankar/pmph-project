\section{Loop accesses}

\subsection{\texttt{run\_OrigCPU}}

Contains a single loop that can be parallelized by privatizing \texttt{strike} and \texttt{globs}.

\subsection{\texttt{value}}

The loop in this function is not parallelizable. It loops over time steps, and
calls \texttt{rollback}, which uses results from previous time steps. This is
sequential in nature.

\subsection{\texttt{updateParams}}

Already parallelizable as each iteration step is independent.

\subsection{\texttt{rollback}}

Contains four outer loops:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Already parallelizable as it writes to \texttt{u[j][i]} without reading from \texttt{u}.
    \item Already parallelizable as it writes to \texttt{v[i][j]} and \texttt{u[j][i]} without reading from \texttt{v} or \texttt{u} for different indices.
    \item The inner loop is already parallelizable as it writes to separate indices of \texttt{a}, \texttt{b} and \texttt{c}. The outer loop cannot be parallelized as it calls \texttt{tridag}, which rewrites \texttt{u} based on previous iterations.
    \item The inner loop is already parallelizable as it writes to separate indices of \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c} and \texttt{y}. The outer loop can, unlike the previous loop, be parallelized by privatizing the aforementioned variables. This is possible because we write to \texttt{myResult} based on \texttt{y} (which is local).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texttt{tridag}}

This can be parallelized by changing the algorithm to the one mentioned in the lectures.
